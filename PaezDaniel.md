# Domain Summary

## Goal
Implement a REST API following *Clean Architecture*, managing two main entities:

- **User**
- **Order**

Expected:

- Use Cases as application services
- DTOs to decouple API <-> Domain
- Relational DB persistence
- Asynchronous flows using Scheduled Jobs or Pending Tasks

---

# Global Evaluation Rules

- Java 21+, Spring Boot recommended
- Must compile on any environment
- Mandatory unit tests
- Feature branches from `develop` (only for Team Challenge)
- Lowercase package naming
- Thin controllers
- Custom exceptions + ControllerAdvice
- Domain objects created via factory methods

---

# Domain Model

## User
```
id: Long
email: String
password: String
status: UserStatus (PENDING, ACTIVE, EXPIRED)
activationCode: String?
activationExpiresAt: LocalDateTime?
createdAt: LocalDateTime
```

## Order
```
id: Long
user: User
status: OrderStatus (PENDING, PROCESSING, APPROVED, REJECTED, CANCELLED)
amount: Decimal
createdAt: LocalDateTime
updatedAt: LocalDateTime
```

---

# Core Business Rules

- `User.email` must be unique
- New users start in **PENDING**
- Activation code expires in 30 minutes
- EXPIRED users cannot be activated
- Only ACTIVE users may create orders
- Valid order transitions:
  - PENDING -> PROCESSING -> APPROVED/REJECTED
  - PENDING -> CANCELLED
- Scheduled jobs must be idempotent
- Export endpoints must generate valid downloadable files

---

# Testing Guidance

- JUnit5 + Mockito
- Clock/TimeProvider should be injected for time-dependent tests
- Cover happy paths, expired tokens, invalid state transitions
- Validate exported file content

---

# Git Workflow (Only for Team Challenge)

- `develop` holds integrated code
- Each use case must be implemented in a feature branch
- Pull Requests require tests passing

---

# Deliverable Checklist

- All assigned endpoints implemented
- Use case logic tested
- Domain factory methods
- Validation + exceptions
- Correct HTTP responses
- One PR per use case (only for Team Challenge)

---

# JSON Examples

## Create User
```json
{
"email": "john@example.com",
"password": "secret123"
}
```

## Create Order
```json
{
"amount": 199.90
}
```

---

# Data Export (Users & Orders)
## Use Cases
- RegisterUser
- Activate User (Scheduled job)
- CreateOrder
- ExportUsersPDF
- ExportOrdersCSV

## Endpoints
- POST /users
- POST /users/{userId}/orders
- GET /users/export/pdf
- GET /orders/export/csv
